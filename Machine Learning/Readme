If the relationship between dependent & independent variable is well approximated by a linear model, 
linear regression will outperform tree based model.

If there is a high non-linearity & complex relationship between dependent & independent variables, 
a tree model will outperform a classical regression method.

If you need to build a model which is easy to explain to people, a decision tree model will always 
do better than a linear model. Decision tree models are even simpler to interpret than linear regression!

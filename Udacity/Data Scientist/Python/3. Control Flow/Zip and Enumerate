Quiz: Zip Coordinates
Use zip to write a for loop that creates a string specifying the label and coordinates of each point
and appends it to the list points.
Each string should be formatted as label: x, y, z. 
For example, the string for the first coordinate should be F: 23, 677, 4.

Use zip to create a dictionary cast that uses names as keys and heights as values.

Quiz: Transpose with Zip
Use zip to transpose data from a 4-by-3 matrix to a 3-by-4 matrix. 
There's actually a cool trick for this! Feel free to look at the solutions if you can't figure it out.

Use enumerate to modify the cast list so that each element contains the name followed by the character's 
corresponding height. For example, the first element of cast should change from "Barney Stinson" to "Barney Stinson 72".

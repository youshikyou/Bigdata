 In these cases, you will be using both quantitative and categorical x-variables to predict a quantitative response. 
 That is, you will be creating equations that like this to predict your response:
 y^=b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+b4x4
 Furthermore, you will learn about how to assess problems that can happen in multiple linear regression, 
 how to address these problems, and how to assess how well your model is performing.
 It turns out Rsquared can be used, but might be misleading. 
 And, unfortunately, the correlation coefficient is only a measure of the linear relationship
 between two quantitative variables, so it will not be very useful in the multiple linear regression case.
 Here is a wonderful free supplementary book: Introduction to Statistical Learning.
 This is an absolutely spectacular book for getting started with machine learning, 
 and Chapter 3 discusses many of the ideas in this lesson. 
 The programming performed in the text is in R, but here is an additional resource,
 not created by the book's authors, that provides Jupyter Notebooks in Python with notes
 and answers to nearly all the questions from the book:

++++++++++++++++How Do We Find the "Right" Coefficients in Multiple Linear Regression+++++++++++++
In the simple linear regression section, you saw how we were interested in minimizing the squared distance
between each actual data point and the predicted value from our model.

But in multiple linear regression, we are actually looking at points that live in not just a two dimensional space.
For a full derivation of how this works, this article provides a breakdown of the steps.
The takeaway for us is that we can find the optimal Î² estimates by calculating (X'X)^{-1}X'y
In the following video, you will use statsmodels to obtain the coefficients 
similar to how we did it in the last concept, but you will also solve for the coefficients 
using the equation above to show the results are not magic.

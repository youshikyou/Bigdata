Using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, you are able to provide statistical significance in making decisions.
However, it is also important to take into consideration practical significance in making decisions. 
Practical significance takes into consideration other factors of your situation that 
might not be considered directly in the results of your hypothesis test or confidence interval.
Constraints like space, time, or money are important in business decisions. 
However, they might not be accounted for directly in a statistical test.

It is important to understand the way that your sample size and confidence level relate 
to the confidence interval you achieve at the end of your analysis.

Assuming you control all other items of your analysis:

Increasing your sample size will decrease the width of your confidence interval.
Increasing your confidence level (say 95% to 99%) will increase the width of your confidence interval.
You saw that you can compute:

The confidence interval width as the difference between your upper and lower bounds of your confidence interval.
The margin of error is half the confidence interval width, 
and the value that you add and subtract from your sample estimate to achieve your confidence interval final results.

Confidence Intervals (& Hypothesis Testing) vs. Machine Learning
Confidence intervals take an aggregate approach towards the conclusions made based on data, 
as these tests are aimed at understanding population parameters (which are aggregate population values).

Alternatively, machine learning techniques take an individual approach towards making conclusions, 
as they attempt to predict an outcome for each specific data point.

A/B tests are used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, 
while the experiment group sees the new version. 
A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. 
These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other. 
A/B testing is very much like hypothesis testing with the following hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis: The new version is no better, or even worse, than the old version
Alternative Hypothesis: The new version is better than the old version
If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest keeping the old version. 
If we reject the null hypothesis, the results would suggest launching the change. 
These tests can be used for a wide variety of changes, from large feature additions to small adjustments in color, 
to see what change maximizes your metric the most.

A/B testing also has its drawbacks.
It can help you compare two options, but it can't tell you about an option you haven’t considered. 
It can also produce bias results when tested on existing users, due to factors like change aversion and novelty effect.

Change Aversion: Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the old version, 
simply because they are unhappy with change, even if it’s ultimately for the better.

Novelty Effect: Existing users may give an unfair advantage to the new version, 
because they’re excited or drawn to the change, even if it isn’t any better in the long run.

=============================AB Test steps===================
We computed the observed difference between the metric, click through rate, for the control and experiment group.
We simulated the sampling distribution for the difference in proportions (or difference in click through rates).
We used this sampling distribution to simulate the distribution under the null hypothesis, 
by creating a random normal distribution centered at 0 with the same spread and size.
We computed the p-value by finding the proportion of values in the null distribution that were greater than our observed difference.
We used this p-value to determine the statistical significance of our observed difference.

===================================Analyze Multiple metrics=============
The more metrics you evaluate, the more likely you are to observe significant differences just by chance - 
similar to what you saw in previous lessons with multiple tests. 
Luckily, this multiple comparisons problem can be handled in several ways.
Since the Bonferroni method is too conservative when we expect correlation among metrics, 
we can better approach this problem with more sophisticated methods, such as the closed testing procedure, 
Boole-Bonferroni bound, and the Holm-Bonferroni method. These are less conservative and take this correlation into account.
If you do choose to use a less conservative method, just make sure the assumptions of that method are truly met in your situation, 
and that you're not just trying to cheat on a p-value(https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/19817).  
Choosing a poorly suited test just to 
get significant results will only lead to misguided decisions that harm your company's performance in the long run.

Difficulties in A/B Testing
As you saw in the scenarios above, there are many factors to consider when designing an A/B test and drawing conclusions
based on its results. To conclude, here are some common ones to consider.
   - Novelty effect and change aversion when existing users first experience a change
   - Sufficient traffic and conversions to have significant and repeatable results
   - Best metric choice for making the ultimate decision (eg. measuring revenue vs. clicks)
   - Long enough run time for the experiment to account for changes in behavior based on time of day/week or
     seasonal events.
   - Practical significance of a conversion rate (the cost of launching a new feature vs. the gain from the increase in conversion)
   - Consistency among test subjects in the control and 
     experiment group (imbalance in the population represented in each group can lead to situations
     like Simpson's Paradox https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)

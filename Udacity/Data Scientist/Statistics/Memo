5M: min,max,mode,mean,median
box plot:minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
Interval quartiel:third quartile-first quartile
right skewed, left skewed, sysmetic(normal distribution)

Statistics and parameters are generally the mean or proportion for a group.
Statistics being the value for the sample. Parameters being the value for the population. 
The population is our entire group of interest, while a sample is the selected subset of the population.



+++++++++++++++++++sampling++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic.

1.The sampling distribution is centered on the original parameter value. !!!!!!!!

2.The sampling distribution decreases its variance depending on the sample size used. 
Specifically, the variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the variance of the original data divided by the sample size used. 
This is always true for the variance of a sample mean!
p*(1-p)/n  is the theoretical variance of the sampling distribution for bionomial distribution.

In general, we say if we have a random variable, X, with variance of σ^2
 , then the distribution of which the sampling distribution of the sample mean, has a variance of (σ^2)/n
 
 
The Central Limit Theorem states that with large enough sample sizes our sample mean will follow a normal distribution, 
but it turns out this is true for more than just the sample mean.

The Law of Large Numbers states that as a sample size increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean.
In general, if our statistic is a "good" estimate of a parameter, it will approach our parameter with larger sample sizes.


+++++++++++++++++++confidence intervals+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, you are able to provide statistical significance in making decisions.
However, it is also important to take into consideration practical significance in making decisions. 
Practical significance takes into consideration other factors of your situation that might not be considered directly in the results of your hypothesis test or confidence interval.
Constraints like space, time, or money are important in business decisions. 
However, they might not be accounted for directly in a statistical test.

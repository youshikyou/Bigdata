The response variable is what you want to predict, while the explanatory variable is the variable 
you use to predict the response. A common way to visualize the relationship 
between two variables in linear regression is using a scatterplot.
You will see more on this in the concepts ahead.

Scatter plots
Scatter plots are a common visual for comparing two quantitative variables. 
A common summary statistic that relates to a scatter plot is the correlation coefficient commonly denoted by r.
Though there are a few different ways(https://www.statisticssolutions.com/correlation-pearson-kendall-spearman/)
to measure correlation between two variables,
the most common way is with Pearson's correlation coefficient(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). 
Pearson's correlation coefficient provides the:
  -Strength
  -Direction
of a linear relationship. 
Spearman's Correlation Coefficient(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) 
does not measure linear relationships specifically, 
and it might be more appropriate for certain cases of associating two variables.

Correlation coefficient
It is used for two variables.

++++++ P value for slope in python model++++++++++++
We can perform hypothesis tests for the coefficients in our linear models using Python (and other software).
These tests help us determine if there is a statistically significant linear relationship between a particular variable 
and the response. The hypothesis test for the intercept isn't useful in most cases.
However, the hypothesis test for each x-variable is a test of if that population slope is equal to zero vs. 
an alternative where the parameter differs from zero. Therefore, if the slope is different than zero
(the alternative is true), we have evidence that the x-variable attached to that coefficient 
has a statistically significant linear relationship with the response.
This in turn suggests that the x-variable should help us in predicting the response 
(or at least be better than not having it in the model).

+++++++++ Rsquared+++++++++++++++++
The Rsquared value is the square of the correlation coefficient.
A common definition for the Rsquared variable is that it is the amount of variability in the response variable
that can be explained by the x-variable in our model. In general, the closer this value is to 1, 
the better our model fits the data.
Many feel that Rsquared isn't a great measure (which is possibly true), 
but I would argue that using cross-validation can assist us with validating any measure
that helps us understand the fit of a model to our data. 
Here, you can find one such argument explaining why one individual doesn't care for Rsquared.

The response variable is what you want to predict, while the explanatory variable is the variable 
you use to predict the response. A common way to visualize the relationship 
between two variables in linear regression is using a scatterplot.
You will see more on this in the concepts ahead.

Scatter plots
Scatter plots are a common visual for comparing two quantitative variables. 
A common summary statistic that relates to a scatter plot is the correlation coefficient commonly denoted by r.
Though there are a few different ways(https://www.statisticssolutions.com/correlation-pearson-kendall-spearman/)
to measure correlation between two variables,
the most common way is with Pearson's correlation coefficient(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). 
Pearson's correlation coefficient provides the:
  -Strength
  -Direction
of a linear relationship. 
Spearman's Correlation Coefficient(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) 
does not measure linear relationships specifically, 
and it might be more appropriate for certain cases of associating two variables.

5M: min,max,mode,mean,median
box plot:minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
Interval quartiel:third quartile-first quartile
right skewed, left skewed, sysmetic(normal distribution)

Statistics and parameters are generally the mean or proportion for a group.
Statistics being the value for the sample. Parameters being the value for the population. 
The population is our entire group of interest, while a sample is the selected subset of the population.

+++++++++++++++++++sampling++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic.

1.The sampling distribution is centered on the original parameter value. !!!!!!!!

2.The sampling distribution decreases its variance depending on the sample size used. 
Specifically, the variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the variance of the original data divided by the sample size used. 
This is always true for the variance of a sample mean!
p*(1-p)/n  is the theoretical variance of the sampling distribution for bionomial distribution.

In general, we say if we have a random variable, X, with variance of σ^2
 , then the distribution of which the sampling distribution of the sample mean, has a variance of (σ^2)/n
 
 
The Central Limit Theorem states that with large enough sample sizes our sample mean will follow a normal distribution, 
but it turns out this is true for more than just the sample mean.

The Law of Large Numbers states that as a sample size increases, the sample mean will get closer to the population mean.
In general, if our statistic is a "good" estimate of a parameter, it will approach our parameter with larger sample sizes.

bootstrapping:自助法是一种从给定训练集中有放回的均匀抽样
想要得到一个population的parameter，我们用statistics的方法去逼近。
statistics的方法是，首先我们有一个样本集合，从这个样本集合里面，我们需要采集N个样本（N要合理的多，大数定理），
然后利用bootstrapping方法，找到抽取样本的正太分布，抽取次数越多，样本的正态分布中心越趋近于population中的parameter
比如要研究喝咖啡人的概率,我们只有200 个人的数据，我们有放回的从这200人中抽N=100次，组成一个样本集合，然后重复10000次，
这样相当于我们有10000个的100个人的样本，然后去利用这个样本去做发现正态分布，这个正太分布的中心就接近于喝咖啡人的真实概率。

+++++++++++++++++++confidence intervals+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, you are able to provide statistical significance in making decisions.
However, it is also important to take into consideration practical significance in making decisions. 
Practical significance takes into consideration other factors of your situation that might not be considered directly in the results of your hypothesis test or confidence interval.
Constraints like space, time, or money are important in business decisions. 
However, they might not be accounted for directly in a statistical test.

It is important to understand the way that your sample size and confidence level relate to the confidence interval you achieve at the end of your analysis.

Assuming you control all other items of your analysis:

Increasing your sample size will decrease the width of your confidence interval.
Increasing your confidence level (say 95% to 99%) will increase the width of your confidence interval.
You saw that you can compute:

The confidence interval width as the difference between your upper and lower bounds of your confidence interval.
The margin of error is half the confidence interval width, 
and the value that you add and subtract from your sample estimate to achieve your confidence interval final results.

Confidence Intervals (& Hypothesis Testing) vs. Machine Learning
Confidence intervals take an aggregate approach towards the conclusions made based on data, 
as these tests are aimed at understanding population parameters (which are aggregate population values).

Alternatively, machine learning techniques take an individual approach towards making conclusions, 
as they attempt to predict an outcome for each specific data point.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++hypothesis testing++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The H_0,H_0 is true before you collect any data.

H_0  usually states there is no effect or that two groups are equal.

The H_0 and H_1 are competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.
H1 is what we would like to prove to be true.
H_0 contains an equal sign of some kind - either =, <=, or >=.

H_1 contains the opposition of the null - either ≠, >>, or <<.
You saw that the statement, "Innocent until proven guilty" is one that suggests the following hypotheses are true:
H_0 Innocent
H_1 Guilty

We can relate this to the idea that "innocent" is true before we collect any data.
Then the alternative must be a competing, non-overlapping hypothesis. 
Hence, the alternative hypothesis is that an individual is guilty.

Perceptron Algorithm
Recall that the perceptron step works as follows. For a point with coordinates (p,q), label y, 
and prediction given by the equation \hat{y} = step(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b) 
If the point is correctly classified, do nothing.
If the point is classified positive, but it has a negative label, subtract αp, αq and α from w_1, w_2 and b respectively.
If the point is classified negative, but it has a positive label, add αp,αq, and α to w_1, w_2 and b respectively.
